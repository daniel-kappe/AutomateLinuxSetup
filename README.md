# Setup Linux (Fedora/Ubuntu) with zsh and neovim
This collection of python scripts autoinstalls Fedora (and maybe later also Ubuntu/Mint)
with zsh and neovim and my favorite plugins. Sets up configuration for git and npm, as
well as a new pair of ssh keys

## HowTo run the script
Clone the existing repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/daniel-kappe/linux-install
```

Customize the .json files.

Then run `./install` inside the git repository
